## Day 10

I almost gave up here today. Part 1 wasn't too bad, and I managed to mangle my way through it. But part 2 was painful. I was ready to throw in the towel for 2020 except for the fact that someone pointed out that there's a similar problem in _Cracking the Coding Interview_, so I was able to read more about the problem there. Once I'd written that, I went back and refactored my part 1 code (my original solution is commented out for posterity/shame).

``` $ time python 1.py
