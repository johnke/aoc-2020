## Day 11

Well, there we are.

Every year, AOC reaches a point where I'm spending more than an hour a day working on a problem. As someone with a full-time job and two children under the age of 5, my free time is my most preciously guarded commodity. An hour a day is hard. An hour a day at the weekend is nearly impossible. Day 10 took me over an hour. I read the description of Day 11 and realised this would probably take longer.

Maybe I'll revisit this repo when my kids are older and I've got a spare afternoon.
